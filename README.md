## üìä Dashboard Walkthrough & Insights

### 1. High-Level Overview
The main page provides a bird's-eye view of all key performance indicators. This allows stakeholders to quickly assess the overall health of marketing efforts.

### 2. Channel Performance Analysis
Using the "Channel" slicer, we can isolate performance. For example, filtering for "Email Marketing" reveals it has the highest ROI, while "Social Media" drives the most impressions. This suggests an opportunity to reallocate budget towards more cost-effective channels.

### 3. Product-Specific Deep Dive
By selecting a specific product, all visuals update to reflect its performance. This helped identify that "Product X" has a high conversion rate but low ad spend, indicating potential for scaled growth with an increased budget.
